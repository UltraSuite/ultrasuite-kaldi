# Speaker diarization
This directory contains example scripts for speaker diarization on the [UltraSuite Repository](<https://ultrasuite.github.io/>).

The subdirectories "v1" and so on are different diarization recipes. The recipe in `v1` demonstrates a supervised approach using HMM-GMMs trained on a very small set of annotated that (1.75 hours) from the UXTD data.
